# Zillow Project
This is our first partner project using an organization to coordinate on Github. 

## What variables contribute to the logerror of Zillow's Zestimates?

## Audience: Our Data Science Class
- We will use our Jupyter Notebook to do a walkthrough of our process and findings.
## Goals:
- Build a model that can predict the target variable of logerror.
- Predict a continuous variable, logerror.
- Find any patterns that may be in the residuals.
## Requirements:
- Use clustering in one or more stages of your process.
- Discuss highlights or discoveries from the data, from the project, and from data science.
- Creates .py modules that hold any functions you use throughout the project.
## Deliverables:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Supporting Modules with functions
## Want to run this yourself? You need...
